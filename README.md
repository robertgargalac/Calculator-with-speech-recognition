# Calculator-with-speech-recognition
This is my very first project made in VB.NET and its main purpose was to get familiar with the programming language and .NET framework . For using speech recognition properly you should do as follow: - make sure the start speech button is pressed;     
-for more accurate recognition you are supposed to use it in a silent room;     
-if you want, for instance, to do : 109 + 55 instead of saying one hundred nine plus fifty five equals you MUST say one zero nine plus five five equals -make sure you always say equals at the end   ; 
-and finally, press DO THE MATH button to perform the action;
